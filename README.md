Project created while I was doing my internship as a student of OpenClassrooms.

This was my first contact with Javascript. I did not create the layout and I did not develop the backend for this project - my only mission was to write the Javascript code (which can be find in the 'js' folder).

I am happy to share it with all the Github comunity!
